        <li><section id="TM1"><h2>Agtech surpasses expectations; is there a bubble</h2><a href="#top">top</a></section>
            <p>
                The $4.6 billion that was raised in 2015 is nearly double 2014’s $2.36 billion total, and outpaced growth in the broader venture capital market. <br>
                Annual global financing of VC-backed companies grew 78% in 2014 on 2013 levels, and a further 44% in 2015, according to the Venture Pulse Report 2015. By comparison, agtech investment grew 166% in 2014 and 92% for 2015. <br>
                This rapid growth against the backdrop of a frothy market raises the question: is agtech in a bubble? <br>
                While we think that the food e-commerce sector continues to be overheated against a backdrop of questionable unit economics and increasing competition, we believe that much of the rest of the market is still facing financing challenges not seen in other mainstream technology sectors. Indeed, outside of food e-commerce, we see very few deals of over $50 million in size and agtech dedicated funds are still relatively few and small in size. <br>
                Another way to sanity check the market is to compare agtech investment with the global agriculture market. In 2015, global agriculture represented about 10% of global GDP ($7.8 trillion). That means that agtech investment is less than 0.5% of the entire agriculture market. <br>
                Moreover, total agtech investment is &lt;3.5% of the $128.5 billion invested in venture backed companies in 2015 – which seems small for a sector responsible for 10% of GDP. By comparison, health care represents about 12% of global GDP and received nearly 12% of total venture funding last year; that’s over three times the total investment in agtech.

        <li><section id="TM2"><h2>The sky's the limit for drones &amp; robotics</h2><a href="#top">top</a></section>
            <p>
                In contrast to food e-commerce, drones &amp; robotics can take human labor out of the equation, and have enormous potential improve operating margins. The 237% increase in investment on 2014 volumes to $389 million in 2015 reflects a bullish investor sentiment. <br>
                Drones made up the vast majority of this total with DJI’s $75 million Series B and 3D Robotics’ $50 million Series C listed in the year’s top 15 equity deals across the whole sector. <br>
                Questions were raised in 2015 around the efficacy of drones for agriculture, such as the time taken to process and analyze images, and the manpower needed to launch and groundtruth the findings. While 80% of UAVs will be used for precision ag in the near future, more progress needs to be made in the technology attached to drones before this segment will create real efficiencies for farmers. <br>
                In robotics, Blue River Technologies, a Californian startup using computer vision and machine learning to weed crops, raised $17 million in Series B funding. Investors included agtech VC heavyweights Syngenta Ventures, Monsanto Growth Ventures, and Pontifax Global Food and Agriculture Technology Fund, as well as big name VCs Khosla Ventures and Innovation Endeavors. But despite this impressive line-up, it was one of very few robotics startups to raise funding (5 out of 26 deals). <br>
                Some investors are concerned that robotics companies are too capital intensive compared to software companies, and that hardware is easier to copy and expensive to distribute. But as global technology giants increasingly turn their corporate venturing arms towards agriculture – think Yamaha, Intel and Verizon – this segment could attract more funding in 2016.

        <Li><section id="TM3"><h2>Biologicals dug in with $120m</h2><a href="#top">top</a></section>
            <p>
            Companies manufacturing biological inputs such as biopesticides, biofertilizers, and soil amendments, largely dominated this year’s soil &amp; crop technology segment raising $120 million across 20 deals. This represents 71% of the subsector’s $168 million total, leaving seed tech and ag genetics companies to make up the remaining 29%. <br>
            The growth in the number of biological solutions for farmers coincides with increasing emphasis among entrepreneurs, farmers and consumers globally on improving soil health; pursuing sustainable farming practices; and reducing the use of chemical inputs. <br>
            Biologicals attracted a swathe deep-pocketed investors including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, The University of Texas Investment Management Company, Sequoia Capital, and the corporate venturing arms of agribusiness giants Monsanto and Syngenta. <br>
            As awareness of the importance of soil health increases, particularly with global climate change talks gathering pace, we believe that a growing numbers of environmentally-aware farmers and organic-eating consumers will keep this segment on an upward trajectory.

        <Li><section id="TM4"><h2>Precision agriculture continues to gather pace </h2><a href="#top">top</a></section>
            <p>
            While it’s still early days for the precision agriculture technology industry – some have likened it to the internet in the 1990s – the segment continues to attract many of the biggest deals. In our spotlight below we classify precision ag companies as those aiming to bring efficiencies to the farm – whether through inputs, time or labor – and primarily draw from the categories of decision support technologies, irrigation &amp; water, drones &amp; robotics, and smart equipment &amp; hardware. During the year, some 84 precision ag companies raised $661 million across 96 deals with some coming to the market twice for funding. <br>
            The sheer volume of capital coming into the subsector raised some eyebrows in the industry, particularly as data integration and standardization remain issues. This has arguably made it challenging for some companies in this space to raise funding from new investors.

        <li><section id="TM5"><h2>Increasing geographic diversity</h2><a href="#top">top</a></section>
            <p>
            Companies based in the United States raised just over half of agtech’s total global funding during the year, taking in $2.4 billion. By number of deals, this was 58% of the year’s activity, which is much lower than the 90% share in 2014. We attribute this not only to increased investment in international deals, but also increased reporting by international companies and the continued globalization of private capital markets. <br>
            Israel asserted its runner-up status in agtech innovation with companies collecting nearly $550 million over the year. The country has also climbed the Global Competitiveness Index to rank third in its capacity for innovation, third for the world’s best research institutions, and ninth in the availability of venture capital.<br>
            Innovations from emerging markets India and China took the third ($506m) and fourth slot ($480m) in our geographical rankings respectively. While the vast majority of deals were in Food e-commerce, the two countries are home to leaders in the irrigation space and in the drones space — India’s Jain Irrigation ($120m) and China’s DJI ($75m). With the urgent need for agricultural innovation in both countries, India and China may be well positioned as agtech centers in the coming years.
